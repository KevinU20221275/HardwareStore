# Hardware Store Sales Management Application

This is a sales management application created for a hardware store. The system allows you to manage products, perform sales, and visualize charts that show the best-selling products and monthly sales. The project is built using the **MVC architecture**.

It uses **Dapper** for data access, **AJAX** and **jQuery** for frontend interactions, **DataTables** to enhance table functionality, and **FluentValidation** for model validation. Stored procedures are used in the database to calculate total sales and update product stock.

## Technologies Used

- **Dapper**: Micro ORM for interacting with the database.
- **jQuery**: JavaScript library for DOM manipulation and AJAX.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for UI components.
- **DataTables**: jQuery plugin to enhance HTML tables with pagination, search, and sort.
- **MailKit**: Library for sending emails.
- **MailTrap**: Service for testing email delivery.
- **Chart.js**: Library to render interactive charts.
- **Select2**: jQuery plugin to enhance select boxes.
- **FluentValidation**: Library for validating .NET models.
- **SQL**: Stored procedures to calculate sales totals and update product stock.

## Key Features

### Product Management:
- View available products with quantities and prices.
- Stock is automatically updated after each sale.

### Sales and Details:
- Products can be added to a sale, showing unit price and total by quantity.
- Stock validation to prevent sales of insufficient quantities.
- Ability to remove products from the sale before confirmation.

### Sales Charts:
- Most Sold Products chart.
- Monthly Sales chart.

### Form Validation:
- Validates that products in the sale have sufficient stock.
- Prevents duplicate products in the same sale.
- Validates customer and product selection.
- Uses **FluentValidation** for backend model validation.

### Email Integration:
- **MailKit** is used to send email receipts to customers.
- **MailTrap** is used for testing the email functionality.

### Enhanced Tables:
- Uses **DataTables** to display and interact with product and sales data:
  - Pagination
  - Search
  - Sorting

    $('#details-table tbody tr').each(function () {
        var total = parseFloat($(this).find('.totalDetail').text()) || 0;
        totalSale += total;
    });
    $('#total').text(totalSale.toFixed(2));
}
```

### Form Validation:

## :information_source: Important Notes

### üó£Ô∏è 1. User Interface Language

The application interface is in **Spanish**, as it was developed for a university project. This includes form labels, buttons, menus, and tables.

> üìå You can change the language by editing the Razor views in the `/Views` folder.

---

### üç™ 2. Cookie-Based Login

User authentication is handled using cookies. When a user logs in, a cookie is created to keep the session active.

> üîê Make sure to configure authentication correctly in `Program.cs` and review the cookie expiration settings to match your needs.

---

### üîê 3. User Roles and Access Permissions

The project includes role-based access control implemented in the controllers. These roles restrict access to specific features and sections of the application:

- **Administrador | Administrator**: Full access.
- **Inventario | Inventory**: Access to product and stock management.
- **SoloLectura | ReadOnly**: View-only access.
- **Vendedor | Sales**: Access to create and view sales.
- **Marketing | Marketing**: Access to reports and analytics.

> üõ†Ô∏è To use the system properly, you must adapt role names to your preferred language and check access logic in the sidebar, controllers, and authorization filters.

### üìù Recommendation

If you plan to modify this project for personal or production use, make sure to:

- Translate all interface text to your desired language.
- Configure user roles properly in your database.
- Review access permissions in the controllers.
